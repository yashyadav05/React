# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🚀 Learning React

Welcome to my React learning journey! This repository contains mini-projects, exercises, and useful resources as I learn and build with **React.js**, one of the most powerful JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.

## 📚 What is React?

**React** is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of complex apps efficiently.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Understand JSX and component-based architecture
- ✅ Learn about props and state
- ✅ Explore hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.
- ✅ Build reusable components
- ✅ Understand routing with `React Router`
- ✅ Connect frontend with backend (API integration)
- ✅ Build real-world mini-projects
- ⏳ Learn state management tools (Context API, Redux)
